This was an assignment for Computer Systems Architecture (ASC), in which I had to simulate a unidimensional and a bidimensional storage system in Assembly Intel x86. It's basically a huge array of numbers that is manipulated within certain criteria.<br>
In this project, I:<br>

    learned to efficiently manipulate large amounts of data using very limited resources.
    got accustomed to writing, debugging, and compiling code in Assembly Intel x86.
    successfully followed strict instructions on what the output of every command had to be.

ADD descriptor size – Adds a certain descriptor to the array, which is of size size, and prints the position. <br>

    Example 1: 10022000 -- ADD 3 2 -> 13322000 3: (1,2)
    Example 2: 10022000 -- ADD 3 3 -> 10022333 3: (5,7)

GET descriptor – Returns the start and end coordinates of the descriptor. <br>

    Example 1: 10022000 -- GET 2 -> 2: (3,4)

DELETE descriptor – Removes all appearances of the descriptor. <br>

    Example 1: 10022440 -- DELETE 2 -> 10022440

DEFRAGMENTATION – Moves all relevant descriptors to the left to fill all the gaps created by the DELETE command. <br>

    Example: 10220030 -- DEFRAGMENTATION -> 12230000

Bidimensional is a bit more complex, but I can explain it to you at the interview. 😊
